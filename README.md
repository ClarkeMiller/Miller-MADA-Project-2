# Overview

A template file and folder structure for a data analysis project/paper done with R/Rmarkdown/Github. 

# Pre-requisites

This is a template for a data analysis project using R, Rmarkdown (and variants, e.g. bookdown), Github and a reference manager that can handle bibtex (I recommend [Jabref](http://www.jabref.org/) or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)). It is also assumed that you have a word processor installed (e.g. MS Word or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)). You need that software stack to make use of this template.

# Getting started

This is a Github template repository. The best way to get it and start using it is [by following these steps.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)


# Project structure

* All data goes into the subfolders inside the `data` folder.
* All code goes into the `code` folder or subfolders.
* All results (figures, tables, computed values) go into `results` folder or subfolders.
* All products (manuscripts, supplement, presentation slides, web apps, etc.) go into `products` subfolders.
* The folders have readme files with a bit more information.
* In the `products` folder and the `manuscript` subfolder, there is a template for a report written in Rmarkdown (bookdown, to be precise). It shows how to include an example figure from the `results` folder and how to include references from a supplied `bibtex` file.
* See the various `readme.md` files for some more information.

Place all your processing/cleaning/wrangling code in this folder.

You can either have one script that does it all, or multiple scripts that do different things. Those can be R scripts or Rmd files. In either case, document the scripts and what goes on in them so well that someone else (including future you) can easily figure out what is happening.

If scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this. Either as comments in the script, or in a separate text file such as this. Ideally of course in both locations.

Document somewhere what the scripts do, what inputs they take and where they place the output. This should be in the _Processed Data_ folder or a subfolder of that.

Place your various R or Rmd scripts in the appropriate folders.

Each script should be well documented. You can either have them as plain R files, or Rmd files. The scripts should load the appropriate data (e.g. raw or processed), perform actions, and save results (e.g. processed data, figures, computed values) in the appropriate folders.

Depending on your specific project, you might want to have further sub-folders.

Place all your raw data in this folder.

Don't ever edit the raw data.

Ideally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everyting is automatically reproducible and documented.

Sometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it's close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won't import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. 

If you can't directly read the data into R and need to make some changes before, make copies of your raw data AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. 

Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.

The folders inside this folder should contain all the products of your project.

For a classical academic project, this will be a peer-reviewed manuscript. 
The `manuscript` folder contains a template. This template is structured as a report for a class, but you can easily adjust it.

Most manuscripts these days have supplementary material, place those into the `supplement` folder.

Often, you might make slides for an oral presentation, place those in the `slides` folder.

Other folders that are not present but you might want to create are a `poster` folder for making a scientific poster, and a `website` folder if you plan to write a blog-post or make an interactive shiny-app for your project.  

Often you need a library of references in bibtex format, as well as a CSL style file that determines reference formatting. Since those files might be used by several of the products, I'm placing them in the main products folder. Feel free to re-organize.

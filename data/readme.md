The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.

You should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and do not edit it.

If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder. 

Add as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.
